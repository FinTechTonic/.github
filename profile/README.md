### Orchestrating the Future of Financial Intelligence

[FinTechTonic](https://github.com/fintechtonic) is an open-source initiative by [Tonic-AI](https://github.com/tonic-ai) dedicated to building **Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments** for financial LLMs. We provide "live-fire" infrastructure, compliant tooling, and high-fidelity data environments to train agents for complex financial transactions and analysis.

## 🛠️ The Ecosystem

### 🏗️ Tooling & Infrastructure
### 🧪 Data Labs & Observability
### 🧠 RL & Training
## 🎯 Sovereign Intelligence

Together, these tools produce small, highly-specialized models that can be used inside agentic harnesses to:
- **🚀 Improve Performance**: Task-specific accuracy that exceeds general-purpose models.
- **🛡️ Maintain Sovereignty**: Local execution of critical financial logic without data leakage.
- **📈 Accelerate Innovation**: Open-source infrastructure that lowers the barrier to entry for financial AI.
