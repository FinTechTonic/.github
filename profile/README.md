# 🙋🏻‍♂️ Welcome to 💵 FinTechTonic

### Orchestrating the Future of Financial Intelligence

[FinTechTonic](https://github.com/fintechtonic) is an open-source initiative by [Tonic-AI](https://github.com/tonic-ai) dedicated to building **Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments** for financial LLMs. We provide "live-fire" infrastructure, compliant tooling, and high-fidelity data environments to train agents for complex financial transactions and analysis.

## 🛠️ The Ecosystem

We are building a complete stack for financial AI, from infrastructure to specialized training kernels.

### 🏗️ Tooling & Infrastructure
*The backbone of compliant financial operations and data extraction.*

*   **[CreditNexus](https://github.com/fintechtonic/creditnexus)**: A next-gen financial OS bridging legal contracts with physical reality via satellite imagery (NDVI) and FINOS CDM compliance.
*   **[OpenBank / EasyMultiBank](https://github.com/fintechtonic/easymultibank)**: Standardized banking interfaces for multi-institution orchestration and transaction testing.
*   **Stock-Prediction**: market analysis and predictive modeling environments.

### 🧪 Data Labs & Observability
*Turning financial noise into actionable training signals.*

*   **[Coming Soon]** We are preparing our open-source data pipelines and monitoring suites to provide transparent observability into agentic financial workflows.

### 🧠 RL & Training
*Small, sovereign models for high-performance agentic harnesses.*

*   **Kernels & Scripts**: Optimized training loops for financial tasks.
*   **Notebooks & HF**: Ready-to-use research and model weights on [HuggingFace](https://hf.co/tonic).
*   **OpenEnv**: Standardized RL environments for training "Financial-First" agents.
*   *(All items currently in active development)*

## 🎯 Our Mission: Sovereign Intelligence

Together, these tools produce small, highly-specialized models that can be used inside agentic harnesses to:
- **🚀 Improve Performance**: Task-specific accuracy that exceeds general-purpose models.
- **🛡️ Maintain Sovereignty**: Local execution of critical financial logic without data leakage.
- **📈 Accelerate Innovation**: Open-source infrastructure that lowers the barrier to entry for financial AI.
